CPLEX Implementation for Virtual Network Embedding with 1 + 1 Network Protection
================================================================================

Dependencies
------------

The implementation uses IBM ILOG CPLEX C++ API (version 12.5 of CPLEX Studio).
We assume CPLEX is installed in /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio125. In case CPLEX is
installed in a different directory replace /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio125 in the
Makefile with the CPLEX installation directory.

How to run
----------
$ make
$ ./vne_protection --pn_topology_file=<physical_network_topology>\ 
                   --vn_topology_file=<virtual_network_topology>

Two example physical (test_pn.topo) and virtual (test_vn.topo) network topology
files are provided with the distribution. 

Input file format
-----------------
A topology file contains the list of edges. Each line contains a description of
an edge in a comma separated value (CSV) format. Format of a line is as follows:
<LinkID>,<SourceNodeId>,<DestinationNodeId>,<PeerID>,<Cost>,<Bandwidth>,<Latency>
Where,
  LinkID = Id of a link. Ignored for both physical and virtual topology.
  SourceNodeId = 0-based node index of the source of the link*
  DestinationNodeId = 0-based node index of the destination of the link*
  PeerID = Ignored
  Cost = Cost of provisioning unit bandwidth on this link. Cost is ignored for
         virtual links.
  Bandwidth = Available bandwidth of a physical link. In case of virtual link,
              this is the bandwidth requirement
  Delay = Latency of a physical link. In case of virtual link, this is the
          maximum delay requirement for the virtual link.

*Nodes are numberded from 0 ... (n - 1) in a network with n nodes.
